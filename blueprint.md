# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern, visually appealing calculator application built with Flutter. It features a "glassmorphism" design, with a translucent, blurred background that gives the UI a sense of depth. The calculator supports both simple and scientific operations, with a smooth animated transition between the two modes.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Design:

*   **Glassmorphism:** The main calculator interface uses a `GlassContainer` to create a frosted-glass effect, with a blurred background and translucent white color.
*   **Background:** A background image is used to create a visually rich and engaging user experience.
*   **Layout:** The layout is clean and intuitive, with a clear separation between the display and the calculator buttons. The buttons are arranged in a grid for easy access.
*   **Typography:** The calculator uses a clean, modern font for the display and buttons, with a clear distinction between the expression and the result.

### Features:

*   **Simple and Scientific Modes:** The calculator supports both basic arithmetic operations and a set of scientific functions. The user can easily switch between the two modes with a button.
*   **State Management:** The app uses the `provider` package for state management, with a `CalculatorProvider` class to manage the calculator's state.
*   **Animated Transitions:** The transition between the simple and scientific modes is animated, providing a smooth and seamless user experience.
*   **Reusable Widgets:** The calculator buttons are implemented as a reusable `CalculatorButton` widget, which promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## Current Plan

This is the first version of the application. The current plan is to finalize the UI and functionality of the calculator, and to ensure that the app is stable and bug-free.
